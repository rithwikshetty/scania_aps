The Air Pressure System (APS) is an essential part of a heavy duty vehicle, where compressed air is used to press the piston that applies pressure on brake pads to stop the vehicle, and is also used in their gear systems. The advantages of having an APS other than a hydraulic setup is the easy availability and sustainability of air from nature.
We have data, sourced from heavy duty Scania trucks, available publicly from the UCI machine learning repository. It consists of failure cases of the trucks during operation. The challenge is to predict the failure of the Air Pressure System (APS) in Scania trucks to avoid failure during truck operation which may lead to a high maintenance cost.
